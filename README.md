# TimesUp

## Overview

“TimesUp” provides real-time crowd insights for customers, restaurants, and vendors, helping them manage wait times and preparation, while also addressing overcrowding and uneven customer distribution during the FIFA event in Vancouver by guiding users to less crowded venues and supporting local businesses.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applies user-centred design principles, integrates mapping features, and utilizes Firebase backend services to store user favourites and recent activity.

## Acknowledgments


- restaurant data and images from Yelp, and vendors from the open data of the city of Vancouver https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/food-vendors/information/ are for demonstration purposes only.
- Code snippets were adapted from COMP 1800 demos.
- Logo generation initially sourced from [ace.ai](https://app.ace.ai/) and vendor images from online research.


---


## Limitations and Future Work


### Limitations


- Limited vendor details (e.g., images, addresses and detailed information in the vendor).
- Accessibility and special request features can be further improved.


### Future Work


- Implement map view and directions.
- Add filtering and sorting options on the home page, like a featured vendor page (e.g., by select food types, busyness and special requests).
- Create a dark mode for better usability in low-light conditions.
- notify the users when they are close to the restaurant, so they can receive or update the status.
